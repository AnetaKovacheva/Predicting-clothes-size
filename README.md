# Predicting-clothes-size

This Notebook explores and models Kaggle's dataset for predicting clothes size. It is assumed that a person's height, weight, and age are reliable predictors for a garment's size. At first glance, it seems the classification task is quite simple since common sense suggests that a shirt's or pants' size depends on person's body measurements. However, it turned out that this logic is wrong. The dataset is explored, cleaned, visualized and pre-processed. Garments' size is predicted with Random Forest Classifier and with a Neural Network.
